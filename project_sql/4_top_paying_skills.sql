Here us a breakdown of the results for top paying skills
- Top pay comes from scale, not analysis: Skills like PySpark, Databricks, Airflow, Kubernetes dominate salaries because they power large, production-grade data systems — pushing roles toward data engineering and platform work.

- ML execution beats ML theory: Tools that deploy and operationalize models (DataRobot, Watson, CI/CD, cloud) pay more than pure analytics or modeling, reflecting demand for business-ready AI.

- Traditional analytics is table stakes: Python, Pandas, SQL, and BI tools remain essential, but only command top pay when paired with cloud, engineering, or ML infrastructure skills.
